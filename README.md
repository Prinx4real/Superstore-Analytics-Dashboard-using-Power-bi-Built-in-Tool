# Superstore-Analytics-Dashboard-using-Power-bi-Built-in-Tool

## Objective:
 The primary objective is aimed to analyses sales, profit, return order and trends to identify key performance pattern. By evaluating key performance profitability, sales and customer segment performance, the project provides actionable insights to optimize inventory, pricing and marketing strategies. The goal is to enhance profitability, improve decision making and drive business growth through data driven decision.

## #Problem Statement
1. Find the metrics of sales, Profits, % of returns orders, show % change vs previous year.
2. Compare sales performance vs previous year over time
3. Determine the most profitable product and the least most profitable product.
4. Find the place where most of the profit is happening.
5. Calculate profit and sales made by each segment.




## Tools and Methodology:
### Tools:
Power Query: Used power query to clean and restructure data for modelling to optimize performance speed.
Dax: Employed Dax functionalities to create a new table and calculate specific measures for key metrics and custom visuals.
Power BI: To build the interactive dashboard.
### Method:
Data Cleaning: This process of data cleaning carried out in this project includes:
•	Handling missing numeric values,
•	Merging first and last name columns together and trimming off unwanted spaces,
•	Handling inconsistencies such as incorrect spellings,
•	Grouping age column into intervals,
•	Lastly, standardizing specific data fields.
Data Processing: With Power Bi's Dax functionalities, I created calculated measures to show valuable metrics, customized and design visuals to aid clarity in understanding trends.
Data Modeling: Modeling this data allows for multiple tables with lesser column information to speed up processing time, reduce redundancy and increase efficiency.

Data Visualization: Built a page interactive  dashboards to properly communicate findings that will foster opportunities to optimize inventory, pricing and marketing strategies.

## Recommendation:
1.	Capitalize on High-Performing Categories and Regions
Focus investment and promotional strategies on the Technology category, especially Copiers, which yielded the highest profit ($56,093.94). Additionally, states such as California, New York, and Texas, which collectively account for the highest profits, should be prioritized for inventory allocation and localized marketing efforts.
2.	Optimize Inventory and Pricing for Low-Performing Segments
The Furniture category, particularly Tables, showed the lowest profit margin ($17,753.21). This calls for a review of pricing strategies, supplier contracts, and demand forecasting to improve margins or consider reducing exposure to underperforming products.
3.	Leverage Consumer Segment for Targeted Marketing
With 50.32% of sales and highest profitability coming from the Consumer segment, targeted marketing campaigns, loyalty programs, and personalized promotions should be designed to further strengthen this segment’s engagement and retention.
4.	Reduce Return Orders
The 5.7% return rate, though improved from last year, still presents an opportunity. Investigating the root causes of returns (e.g., product quality, delivery issues) and implementing quality checks or customer feedback loops can help further minimize returns and associated costs.
5.	Data-Driven Decision Making
Maintain and continuously refine dashboard analytics to track sales trends, customer preferences, and regional performance. Use these insights to dynamically adjust pricing, tailor promotions, and optimize inventory, ensuring the business remains responsive to market shifts.
6.	Expand High-Performing Markets and Products
Explore opportunities to replicate successful strategies from top-performing states and product categories in underperforming regions, fostering consistent growth across markets.
By leveraging these insights and focusing on high-impact areas, the superstore can improve decision-making, boost profitability, and scale operations more effectively through a data-driven growth strategy.
